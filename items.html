It allows you to travel all round the map faster than running and allows you to jump high and glide as well without Clank behide your back. You can see Ratchet using the hoverboots on the background of this page.</p>

The Swingshot is used for swinging across places. When you see a green or yellow device in the sky, you can swing on it. The Swingshot is in every Ratchet and Clank and I hope it'll be in the next one as well. It won't really feel like a Ratchet and Clank game if it was removed.

It was orignially named "Robo Wings" and it looks like wings but then it changed to the jetpack after that and the Robo Wings were never seen again in the rest of the series. Basically the jetpack and the robo wings allowed you to fly and explore big freeroaming areas only on certain planets. It's really fun having shoot outs in the air and made running away from enemies so much easier.</p><h2>The orignial design</h2><img src="https://en.ratchet-galaxy.com/images/racod/artworks/Insomniac_Games/gadgets/Robo-wings.jpg" height="150" width="200" class="imgCenter">

Ratchet and Clank defeats the masked thief and get back the experiment. The two heroes were betrayed by Mr. Fizzwidget by destroying their ship and leaving them to die in a desert. While they were about to escape the desert, they were confronted by the masked thief, but this time the masked thief revealed herself. The thief is Angela Cross and she is a lombax like Ratchet. The Protopet is a dangerous experiment that kills people. Mr. Fizzwidget duplicated it and started selling the product. Ratchet and Clank and Angela went on to face Mr. Fizzwidget, but they were confronted by the Thug 4 Less group and they kidnapped Angela. After defeating the thugs and saving Angela, they went to the MegaCorp base to stop Fizzwidget once and for all. Little do our heroes know that he wasn't really Mr. Fizzwidget. Captain Qwark disguised as Fizzwidget and put the galaxy in danger and put the blame on Ratchet and Clank because they defeated him and he lost his hero rank. Qwark thought that if he put the galaxy in danger and save it, he could be a hero again. Qwark was then defeated by the Protopet. The Protopet became bigger than its original size because it was being tortured. Ratchet and Clank then defeated the Protopet and found the real Mr. Fizzwidget and found a device to fix all the Protopets that were released into the galaxy.</p>

            <h1>Weapons</h1>
            <p>The Ratchet and Clank series has a crazy amount of fun weapons to use, maybe over 300 or 400 hundred in total. I'll be talking about my three favorite weapons of all time throught the whole series. LOL chosing 3 weapons out of hundreds it pretty tough.</p>

In other words, its a pistol. Each game has different max level upgrade design for the combustor. In Tools of Destruction, when the combustor reaches max level, it turns into a mini gun. In RAC All for One, it shoots three bullets at a time with a fast fire rate instend of one.</p><h3>Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction "Combustor" max level design</h3><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ratchet/images/b/bc/Magma_Combuster.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20101205171350" height="150" width="150" class="imgCenter">

Its a weapon that shoots an electric ball and when it reaches max level, it fires a bigger electric ball and the ball starts zapping enemies that are near or far away from it.</p>

There is a Ryno in almost every game. There are six Rynos in total. There's one in Ratchet Deadlock but it doesn't count cause it has a different name. My favorite Ryno has to be the Ryno V (Ryno 5) because it fires bullets and rockets and the fire rate is like a mini gun. Plus this Ryno plays music everytime you use it.</p>
